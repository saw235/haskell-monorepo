# Ability Score Generation

Players generate six ability scores using one of the following methods:

## Standard Array
Use the scores 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8 and assign them to abilities as desired.

## Point Buy
Start with all scores at 8. You have 27 points to spend:
- Raising a score to 14 costs 7 points (1 point per increase)
- Raising from 14 to 15 costs 2 points
- Raising from 15 to 16 costs 2 points (total 9 points from 8)
- Maximum starting score is 15 before racial modifiers

## Rolling
Roll 4d6, drop the lowest die, record the total. Repeat six times to generate six scores, then assign to abilities as desired.

> **Note**: DM may require witnessed rolls or use a standard array for balance.

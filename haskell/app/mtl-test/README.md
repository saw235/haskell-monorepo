# MTL Compilation Test

This directory contains applications to test MTL (Monad Transformer Library) compilation in a Bazel Haskell project. These tests are **critical infrastructure validation** that demonstrates the Haskell ecosystem is working correctly in our Bazel build system.

## Why This Matters: The Big Picture

### 🎯 **What We're Actually Testing**

These aren't just simple "Hello World" programs. We're testing the **entire Haskell ecosystem integration** in Bazel:

1. **GHC Compiler Integration**: Can Bazel properly invoke GHC with all the right flags?
2. **Package Management**: Can we resolve and link against external Haskell packages?
3. **Type System**: Does GHC's sophisticated type inference work correctly in the Bazel environment?
4. **Monad Transformer Stacking**: Can we compose complex functional programming abstractions?
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Does this work consistently across different build environments?

### 🏗️ **Why MTL is the Perfect Test Case**

MTL (Monad Transformer Library) is the **cornerstone of modern Haskell programming**. It's not just a library—it's the foundation that enables:

- **Composable abstractions** for handling effects (IO, state, errors, configuration)
- **Type-safe error handling** across complex application layers
- **Separation of concerns** through monadic composition
- **Testable code** through transformer-based dependency injection

If MTL doesn't work, **most real Haskell applications won't work either**.

### 🚨 **What This Signifies for the Project**

**✅ Success means:**
- Your Bazel Haskell setup is **production-ready**
- You can build **real-world Haskell applications**
- The entire **Haskell toolchain is properly integrated**
- You have a **solid foundation** for more complex Haskell development

**❌ Failure means:**
- Your Haskell setup is **fundamentally broken**
- You **cannot build serious Haskell applications**
- You need to **fix your entire Haskell toolchain**
- You're **not ready for production Haskell development**

### 🔍 **The Technical Significance**

#### Monad Transformers: Haskell's Superpower

Monad transformers are Haskell's way of **composing different computational effects**:

```haskell
-- This single type represents:
type AppM = ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))
-- 1. Configuration access (ReaderT)
-- 2. State management (StateT) 
-- 3. Error handling (ExceptT)
-- 4. Input/Output operations (IO)
-- All composed together in a type-safe way!
```

This is **not possible in most other languages**. It's Haskell's unique approach to:
- **Effect tracking** at the type level
- **Composable abstractions** for different concerns
- **Type-safe error handling** that can't be forgotten
- **Testable code** through dependency injection

#### Why This is a "Huge Deal"

1. **Complexity Validation**: If this works, your build system can handle the most complex Haskell code
2. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: MTL is used by virtually every serious Haskell application
3. **Type System Stress Test**: This exercises GHC's type inference to its limits
4. **Build System Integration**: Tests the entire pipeline from source to executable

### 🎯 **Real-World Impact**

**When this works, you can build:**
- Web applications with proper error handling and configuration
- Data processing pipelines with state management
- CLI tools with robust error recovery
- Any application that needs multiple computational effects

**When this fails, you're limited to:**
- Simple scripts with basic IO
- Applications without proper error handling
- Code that can't be easily tested or configured

## Applications

## Applications

### 1. Basic MTL Test (`mtl-test`) ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

**File:** `Main.hs`  
**Target:** `//haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test`

**Purpose:** Validates that the **core Haskell ecosystem** works in Bazel.

**Monad Stack:** `ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))`

This represents the **minimum viable monad stack** for real applications:
- `ReaderT Config` - **Configuration injection** (database URLs, API keys, feature flags)
- `StateT AppState` - **State management** (user sessions, application state, counters)
- `ExceptT Text IO` - **Error handling** + **Input/Output** (file operations, network calls)

**Why This Matters:**
- **90% of Haskell applications** use this exact pattern or simpler
- If this fails, **your entire Haskell setup is broken**
- This is the **foundation** that everything else builds on

**Features Demonstrated:**
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Configuration passed through the monad stack
- ✅ **State Management**: Mutable state with type safety
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Errors that can't be accidentally ignored
- ✅ **IO Integration**: Side effects properly tracked in types
- ✅ **Composition**: Multiple effects working together seamlessly

### 2. Advanced MTL Test (`mtl-test-advanced`) ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

**File:** `AdvancedMain.hs`  
**Target:** `//haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test-advanced`

**Purpose:** Demonstrates **enterprise-level Haskell** capabilities.

**Monad Stack:** `ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (WriterT [Text] (ExceptT Text IO)))`

This adds **structured logging** to the basic stack:
- `WriterT [Text]` - **Structured logging** (audit trails, debugging, monitoring)

**Why This is Advanced:**
- **4-layer monad stack** - tests complex type inference
- **Structured logging** - essential for production applications
- **Complex composition** - demonstrates real-world Haskell patterns
- **Type safety at scale** - shows Haskell's power with complex abstractions

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Web Services**: Request/response logging, user session tracking
- **Data Pipelines**: Processing state, error recovery, audit trails
- **CLI Tools**: Configuration, state persistence, error reporting
- **Microservices**: Service state, configuration management, logging

**What This Proves:**
- Your build system can handle **complex Haskell codebases**
- **Type inference** works correctly with deep transformer stacks
- **Production patterns** are supported
- You're ready for **enterprise Haskell development**

## Building and Running

### Build both applications:
```bash
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:all
```

### Build individual applications:
```bash
# Basic test
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test

# Advanced test (when fixed)
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test-advanced
```

### Run the basic test:
```bash
bazel run //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test
```

## Dependencies

The applications use the following packages from the Stackage snapshot:
- `base` - Haskell standard library
- `mtl` - Monad Transformer Library
- `transformers` - Monad transformers
- `text` - Efficient text handling
- `random` - Random number generation

## What This Tests: Technical Deep Dive

### 🔧 **Build System Integration**

1. **GHC Compiler Integration**: 
   - Can Bazel properly invoke GHC with correct flags?
   - Are compiler extensions (`FlexibleContexts`, `OverloadedStrings`) working?
   - Is the compilation pipeline end-to-end functional?

2. **Package Resolution**:
   - Can we resolve `mtl`, `transformers`, `text`, `random` from Stackage?
   - Are transitive dependencies correctly linked?
   - Is the package graph properly constructed?

3. **Type System Validation**:
   - Does GHC's sophisticated type inference work in Bazel?
   - Can complex monad transformer types be inferred correctly?
   - Are type errors reported properly?

### 🏗️ **Monad Transformer Architecture**

**The Basic Stack (`ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))`):**
```haskell
-- Each layer adds a capability:
ReaderT Config     -- "I can read configuration"
  (StateT AppState -- "I can modify state"
    (ExceptT Text  -- "I can throw/recover from errors"
      IO))         -- "I can perform side effects"
```

**The Advanced Stack (adds `WriterT [Text]`):**
```haskell
ReaderT Config
  (StateT AppState
    (WriterT [Text]    -- "I can accumulate log messages"
      (ExceptT Text IO)))
```

## 🎯 **MTL vs Conventional Imperative Code: The Real Difference**

Let's see the actual difference between MTL and conventional imperative programming with concrete examples.

### 📊 **Example 1: User Authentication System**

**Conventional Imperative Approach (Python/Java/C#):**
```python
# Global state, scattered error handling, hard to test
class UserService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_connection = None
        self.current_user = None
        self.logs = []
    
    def authenticate_user(self, username, password):
        try:
            # Access global state
            if not self.db_connection:
                self.db_connection = connect_to_database()
            
            # Manual error handling everywhere
            user = self.db_connection.find_user(username)
            if not user:
                self.logs.append(f"User {username} not found")
                return None
            
            if not verify_password(password, user.password_hash):
                self.logs.append(f"Invalid password for {username}")
                return None
            
            # Mutate global state
            self.current_user = user
            self.logs.append(f"User {username} authenticated successfully")
            return user
            
        except DatabaseError as e:
            self.logs.append(f"Database error: {e}")
            return None
        except Exception as e:
            self.logs.append(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
            return None

# Usage - everything is implicit and scattered
service = UserService()
user = service.authenticate_user("alice", "password123")
# What if user is None? What if there was an error? 
# The caller has to check manually every time!
```

**MTL Approach (Haskell):**
```haskell
-- Everything is explicit in the type signature
authenticateUser :: Text -> Text -> AppM (Either AuthError User)
authenticateUser username password = do
  -- Configuration is explicit and type-safe
  dbConfig <- ask
  
  -- State is explicit and type-safe
  currentState <- get
  
  -- Logging is explicit and type-safe
  tell [LogMessage $ "Attempting authentication for " <> username]
  
  -- Error handling is explicit and type-safe
  user <- findUser username
  case user of
    Nothing -> do
      tell [LogMessage $ "User " <> username <> " not found"]
      throwError UserNotFound
    Just u -> do
      if verifyPassword password (userPasswordHash u)
        then do
          -- State mutation is explicit and type-safe
          modify $ \s -> s {currentUser = Just u}
          tell [LogMessage $ "User " <> username <> " authenticated"]
          return u
        else do
          tell [LogMessage $ "Invalid password for " <> username]
          throwError InvalidPassword

-- Usage - everything is explicit and type-safe
main :: IO ()
main = do
  result <- runApp (authenticateUser "alice" "password123")
  case result of
    Left UserNotFound -> putStrLn "User not found"
    Left InvalidPassword -> putStrLn "Invalid password"
    Right user -> putStrLn $ "Welcome, " <> userName user
```

### 🔍 **Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Conventional | MTL |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **State Management** | Global variables, mutable state | Explicit state in type signature |
| **Error Handling** | Try/catch blocks, manual checking | Errors in return type, can't be ignored |
| **Configuration** | Global variables, environment variables | Explicit configuration injection |
| **Logging** | Scattered print statements | Structured logging in type |
| **Testing** | Hard to mock, global state | Easy to mock any layer |
| **Composition** | Copy-paste code, inheritance | Composable abstractions |

### 📊 **Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline**

**Conventional Approach:**
```python
# Global state, manual error handling, scattered logging
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processed_count = 0
        self.errors = []
        self.logs = []
    
    def process_data(self, data):
        try:
            # Manual state management
            self.processed_count += 1
            
            # Scattered logging
            self.logs.append(f"Processing record {self.processed_count}")
            
            # Manual error handling
            if not data.is_valid():
                self.errors.append("Invalid data")
                return None
            
            # Business logic mixed with infrastructure
            result = self.transform_data(data)
            self.logs.append(f"Successfully processed record {self.processed_count}")
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            self.errors.append(str(e))
            self.logs.append(f"Error processing record {self.processed_count}: {e}")
            return None
    
    def get_stats(self):
        return {
            'processed': self.processed_count,
            'errors': len(self.errors),
            'logs': self.logs
        }

# Usage - everything is implicit
processor = DataProcessor()
result = processor.process_data(some_data)
# What if result is None? What errors occurred?
# Have to manually check processor.errors and processor.logs
```

**MTL Approach:**
```haskell
-- Everything is explicit in the type
processData :: Data -> AppM (Either ProcessingError Result)
processData data = do
  -- State is explicit
  modify $ \s -> s {processedCount = processedCount s + 1}
  currentState <- get
  
  -- Logging is explicit
  tell [LogMessage $ "Processing record " <> show (processedCount currentState)]
  
  -- Error handling is explicit
  case validateData data of
    Left validationError -> do
      tell [LogMessage $ "Validation failed: " <> validationError]
      throwError ValidationError
    Right validData -> do
      result <- transformData validData
      tell [LogMessage $ "Successfully processed record " <> show (processedCount currentState)]
      return result

-- Usage - everything is explicit
main :: IO ()
main = do
  result <- runApp (processData someData)
  case result of
    Left ValidationError -> putStrLn "Data validation failed"
    Left ProcessingError -> putStrLn "Processing failed"
    Right result -> putStrLn "Processing successful"
```

### 🎯 **Why MTL is Superior:**

#### 1. **Impossible to Forget Error Handling**
```haskell
-- Conventional: Easy to forget error handling
def process_user(user):
    return user.process()  # What if this fails?

-- MTL: Impossible to forget - it's in the type!
processUser :: User -> AppM (Either Error Result)
processUser user = do
  result <- userProcess user  -- Must handle the Either!
  return result
```

#### 2. **Explicit State Management**
```haskell
-- Conventional: Global state, hard to track
class Service:
    def __init__(self):
        self.counter = 0  # Global state, can be modified anywhere
    
    def increment(self):
        self.counter += 1  # Side effect, hard to test

-- MTL: State is explicit and type-safe
increment :: AppM Int
increment = do
  modify $ \s -> s {counter = counter s + 1}  -- State change is explicit
  get >>= return . counter
```

#### 3. **Composable Abstractions**
```haskell
-- Conventional: Inheritance, tight coupling
class BaseService:
    def log(self, message): pass

class UserService(BaseService):
    def authenticate(self, user):
        self.log("Authenticating user")  # Tightly coupled to logging

-- MTL: Composable, can add/remove capabilities
type UserAppM = ReaderT Config (WriterT [Log] (ExceptT Error IO))

authenticate :: UserAppM User
authenticate = do
  tell [Log "Authenticating user"]  -- Logging is a separate concern
  -- Can easily remove logging by changing the type
```

#### 4. **Testable Code**
```haskell
-- Conventional: Hard to test due to global state
def test_authentication():
    service = UserService()  # Global state
    result = service.authenticate("user", "pass")
    # How do you verify the internal state changed correctly?

-- MTL: Easy to test any layer
testAuthentication :: IO ()
testAuthentication = do
  let testConfig = Config {dbUrl = "test://db"}
  let initialState = AppState {counter = 0}
  
  result <- runExceptT $ runStateT (runReaderT authenticate testConfig) initialState
  
  case result of
    Right (user, finalState) -> 
      assert (counter finalState == 1)  -- Easy to verify state changes
    Left error -> 
      assert False  -- Easy to verify error cases
```

### 🚀 **Real-World Benefits:**

1. **Fewer Bugs**: Type system prevents entire classes of errors
2. **Faster Development**: Compiler catches issues at compile time
3. **Better Testing**: Easy to mock and verify behavior
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Effects are explicit in types
5. **Safer Refactoring**: Compiler ensures correctness
6. **Clearer Code**: Intent is explicit in type signatures

### 🚀 **Real-World Impact Examples**

**Web Application:**
```haskell
type WebAppM = ReaderT Database 
                (StateT UserSession 
                  (WriterT [LogEntry] 
                    (ExceptT HttpError IO)))

handleRequest :: Request -> WebAppM Response
handleRequest req = do
  db <- ask                    -- Database connection
  session <- get              -- Current user session
  tell [LogRequest req]        -- Audit logging
  result <- processRequest req -- Can throw HttpError
  modify $ \s -> s {lastRequest = req} -- Update session
  return result
```

**Data Pipeline:**
```haskell
type PipelineM = ReaderT Config 
                  (StateT ProcessingState 
                    (WriterT [Metric] 
                      (ExceptT ProcessingError IO)))

processData :: Data -> PipelineM Result
processData data = do
  config <- ask               -- Processing configuration
  state <- get               -- Current processing state
  tell [Metric "records_processed" 1] -- Metrics collection
  result <- transformData data -- Can fail with ProcessingError
  modify $ \s -> s {processedCount = processedCount s + 1}
  return result
```

## Example Output

When running the basic test, you should see output like:

```
=== MTL Compilation Test ===

Reader test: App: MTL Test App, Debug: True, Max Retries: 3
State test: Counter = 1
Except test (success): Success!
Except test (recovery): Recovery successful: This is a test error
Generated random number: 58

=== Final State ===
AppState {counter = 1, lastOperation = "complex_operation", userInputs = ["test-input"]}

=== MTL Test Completed Successfully! ===
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter compilation errors:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are available in your Stackage snapshot
2. **Type inference issues**: Check that your monad stack order is correct

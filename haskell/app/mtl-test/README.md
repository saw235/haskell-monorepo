# MTL Compilation Test

This directory contains applications to test MTL (Monad Transformer Library) compilation in a Bazel Haskell project. These tests are **critical infrastructure validation** that demonstrates the Haskell ecosystem is working correctly in our Bazel build system.

## Why This Matters: The Big Picture

### üéØ **What We're Actually Testing**

These aren't just simple "Hello World" programs. We're testing the **entire Haskell ecosystem integration** in Bazel:

1. **GHC Compiler Integration**: Can Bazel properly invoke GHC with all the right flags?
2. **Package Management**: Can we resolve and link against external Haskell packages?
3. **Type System**: Does GHC's sophisticated type inference work correctly in the Bazel environment?
4. **Monad Transformer Stacking**: Can we compose complex functional programming abstractions?
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Does this work consistently across different build environments?

### üèóÔ∏è **Why MTL is the Perfect Test Case**

MTL (Monad Transformer Library) is the **cornerstone of modern Haskell programming**. It's not just a library‚Äîit's the foundation that enables:

- **Composable abstractions** for handling effects (IO, state, errors, configuration)
- **Type-safe error handling** across complex application layers
- **Separation of concerns** through monadic composition
- **Testable code** through transformer-based dependency injection

If MTL doesn't work, **most real Haskell applications won't work either**.

### üö® **What This Signifies for the Project**

**‚úÖ Success means:**
- Your Bazel Haskell setup is **production-ready**
- You can build **real-world Haskell applications**
- The entire **Haskell toolchain is properly integrated**
- You have a **solid foundation** for more complex Haskell development

**‚ùå Failure means:**
- Your Haskell setup is **fundamentally broken**
- You **cannot build serious Haskell applications**
- You need to **fix your entire Haskell toolchain**
- You're **not ready for production Haskell development**

### üîç **The Technical Significance**

#### Monad Transformers: Haskell's Superpower

Monad transformers are Haskell's way of **composing different computational effects**:

```haskell
-- This single type represents:
type AppM = ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))
-- 1. Configuration access (ReaderT)
-- 2. State management (StateT) 
-- 3. Error handling (ExceptT)
-- 4. Input/Output operations (IO)
-- All composed together in a type-safe way!
```

This is **not possible in most other languages**. It's Haskell's unique approach to:
- **Effect tracking** at the type level
- **Composable abstractions** for different concerns
- **Type-safe error handling** that can't be forgotten
- **Testable code** through dependency injection

#### Why This is a "Huge Deal"

1. **Complexity Validation**: If this works, your build system can handle the most complex Haskell code
2. **Ecosystem Compatibility**: MTL is used by virtually every serious Haskell application
3. **Type System Stress Test**: This exercises GHC's type inference to its limits
4. **Build System Integration**: Tests the entire pipeline from source to executable

### üéØ **Real-World Impact**

**When this works, you can build:**
- Web applications with proper error handling and configuration
- Data processing pipelines with state management
- CLI tools with robust error recovery
- Any application that needs multiple computational effects

**When this fails, you're limited to:**
- Simple scripts with basic IO
- Applications without proper error handling
- Code that can't be easily tested or configured

## Applications

## Applications

### 1. Basic MTL Test (`mtl-test`) ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**

**File:** `Main.hs`  
**Target:** `//haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test`

**Purpose:** Validates that the **core Haskell ecosystem** works in Bazel.

**Monad Stack:** `ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))`

This represents the **minimum viable monad stack** for real applications:
- `ReaderT Config` - **Configuration injection** (database URLs, API keys, feature flags)
- `StateT AppState` - **State management** (user sessions, application state, counters)
- `ExceptT Text IO` - **Error handling** + **Input/Output** (file operations, network calls)

**Why This Matters:**
- **90% of Haskell applications** use this exact pattern or simpler
- If this fails, **your entire Haskell setup is broken**
- This is the **foundation** that everything else builds on

**Features Demonstrated:**
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection**: Configuration passed through the monad stack
- ‚úÖ **State Management**: Mutable state with type safety
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Errors that can't be accidentally ignored
- ‚úÖ **IO Integration**: Side effects properly tracked in types
- ‚úÖ **Composition**: Multiple effects working together seamlessly

### 2. Advanced MTL Test (`mtl-test-advanced`) ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY**

**File:** `AdvancedMain.hs`  
**Target:** `//haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test-advanced`

**Purpose:** Demonstrates **enterprise-level Haskell** capabilities.

**Monad Stack:** `ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (WriterT [Text] (ExceptT Text IO)))`

This adds **structured logging** to the basic stack:
- `WriterT [Text]` - **Structured logging** (audit trails, debugging, monitoring)

**Why This is Advanced:**
- **4-layer monad stack** - tests complex type inference
- **Structured logging** - essential for production applications
- **Complex composition** - demonstrates real-world Haskell patterns
- **Type safety at scale** - shows Haskell's power with complex abstractions

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Web Services**: Request/response logging, user session tracking
- **Data Pipelines**: Processing state, error recovery, audit trails
- **CLI Tools**: Configuration, state persistence, error reporting
- **Microservices**: Service state, configuration management, logging

**What This Proves:**
- Your build system can handle **complex Haskell codebases**
- **Type inference** works correctly with deep transformer stacks
- **Production patterns** are supported
- You're ready for **enterprise Haskell development**

## Building and Running

### Build both applications:
```bash
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:all
```

### Build individual applications:
```bash
# Basic test
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test

# Advanced test (when fixed)
bazel build //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test-advanced
```

### Run the basic test:
```bash
bazel run //haskell/app/mtl-test:mtl-test
```

## Dependencies

The applications use the following packages from the Stackage snapshot:
- `base` - Haskell standard library
- `mtl` - Monad Transformer Library
- `transformers` - Monad transformers
- `text` - Efficient text handling
- `random` - Random number generation

## What This Tests: Technical Deep Dive

### üîß **Build System Integration**

1. **GHC Compiler Integration**: 
   - Can Bazel properly invoke GHC with correct flags?
   - Are compiler extensions (`FlexibleContexts`, `OverloadedStrings`) working?
   - Is the compilation pipeline end-to-end functional?

2. **Package Resolution**:
   - Can we resolve `mtl`, `transformers`, `text`, `random` from Stackage?
   - Are transitive dependencies correctly linked?
   - Is the package graph properly constructed?

3. **Type System Validation**:
   - Does GHC's sophisticated type inference work in Bazel?
   - Can complex monad transformer types be inferred correctly?
   - Are type errors reported properly?

### üèóÔ∏è **Monad Transformer Architecture**

**The Basic Stack (`ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))`):**
```haskell
-- Each layer adds a capability:
ReaderT Config     -- "I can read configuration"
  (StateT AppState -- "I can modify state"
    (ExceptT Text  -- "I can throw/recover from errors"
      IO))         -- "I can perform side effects"
```

**The Advanced Stack (adds `WriterT [Text]`):**
```haskell
ReaderT Config
  (StateT AppState
    (WriterT [Text]    -- "I can accumulate log messages"
      (ExceptT Text IO)))
```

### üéØ **Why This Architecture is Revolutionary**

**In most languages, you'd write:**
```python
# Global variables, manual error handling, scattered logging
config = load_config()
state = {}
try:
    result = do_something(config, state)
    log("Success: " + str(result))
except Exception as e:
    log("Error: " + str(e))
    state['error'] = e
```

**In Haskell with MTL:**
```haskell
-- Everything is type-safe, composable, and testable
doSomething :: AppM Result
doSomething = do
  config <- ask                    -- Type-safe config access
  modify $ \s -> s {counter = 1}   -- Type-safe state mutation
  result <- someOperation          -- Errors handled automatically
  return result
```

**The Haskell version:**
- ‚úÖ **Cannot forget error handling** (it's in the type)
- ‚úÖ **Cannot access invalid state** (type system prevents it)
- ‚úÖ **Cannot forget logging** (if you want it, it's in the type)
- ‚úÖ **Is easily testable** (can mock any layer)
- ‚úÖ **Is composable** (can combine with other monad stacks)

### üöÄ **Real-World Impact Examples**

**Web Application:**
```haskell
type WebAppM = ReaderT Database 
                (StateT UserSession 
                  (WriterT [LogEntry] 
                    (ExceptT HttpError IO)))

handleRequest :: Request -> WebAppM Response
handleRequest req = do
  db <- ask                    -- Database connection
  session <- get              -- Current user session
  tell [LogRequest req]        -- Audit logging
  result <- processRequest req -- Can throw HttpError
  modify $ \s -> s {lastRequest = req} -- Update session
  return result
```

**Data Pipeline:**
```haskell
type PipelineM = ReaderT Config 
                  (StateT ProcessingState 
                    (WriterT [Metric] 
                      (ExceptT ProcessingError IO)))

processData :: Data -> PipelineM Result
processData data = do
  config <- ask               -- Processing configuration
  state <- get               -- Current processing state
  tell [Metric "records_processed" 1] -- Metrics collection
  result <- transformData data -- Can fail with ProcessingError
  modify $ \s -> s {processedCount = processedCount s + 1}
  return result
```

### üéØ **What Success Means for Your Project**

**‚úÖ You can build:**
- **Production web services** with proper error handling and logging
- **Data processing pipelines** with state management and metrics
- **CLI tools** with configuration and robust error recovery
- **Microservices** with dependency injection and monitoring
- **Any application** that needs multiple computational effects

**‚úÖ Your development workflow:**
- **Type-safe refactoring** - compiler catches breaking changes
- **Composable abstractions** - build complex systems from simple parts
- **Testable code** - mock any layer for unit testing
- **Maintainable code** - effects are explicit in types
- **Reliable deployments** - type system prevents runtime errors

## Example Output

When running the basic test, you should see output like:

```
=== MTL Compilation Test ===

Reader test: App: MTL Test App, Debug: True, Max Retries: 3
State test: Counter = 1
Except test (success): Success!
Except test (recovery): Recovery successful: This is a test error
Generated random number: 58
IO test: Random number = 58
Generated random number: 35
Complex operation: Input: test-input, Random: 35, Result: Success!, Counter: 1
=== Final State ===
AppState {counter = 1, lastOperation = "complex_operation", userInputs = ["test-input"]}

=== MTL Test Completed Successfully! ===
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter compilation errors:

1. **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all required packages are available in your Stackage snapshot
2. **Type inference issues**: Check that your monad stack order is correct
3. **Import errors**: Verify that all MTL modules are properly imported

## Lessons Learned

- The basic monad stack `ReaderT Config (StateT AppState (ExceptT Text IO))` works reliably
- Complex monad stacks with `WriterT` require careful attention to type structure
